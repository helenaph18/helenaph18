### Hi there! My name is Helen! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a second year **Computer Science** major at the University of California, Irvine.  

I am quite new to tech and coding so I am very eager to learn as much as I can about the tech industry and to expand my skill sets. Aside from school work, I enjoy reading, listening to music, and watching movies with my family.
